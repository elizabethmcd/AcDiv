# Diversity of the 'Candidatus Accumulibacter' lineage 

This project reevaluated the population structure and microdiversity of the polyphosphate-accumulating organism (PAO) 'Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis' using genome-resolved metagenomics. Genomes were collected from publicly available datasets, lab-scale bioreactors ran at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, and a Danish full-scale WWTP. Inter- and intra-clade diversity was assessed as well as strain heterogeneity through space and time for multiple studies.
