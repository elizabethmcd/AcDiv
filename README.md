# Diversity of the 'Rhodocyclaceae' lineage 

This project reevaluated the population structure and microdiversity of the polyphosphate-accumulating organism (PAO) 'Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis' and related Rhodocyclaceae lineages using genome-resolved metagenomics. Genomes were collected from publicly available datasets, lab-scale bioreactors ran at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, and a Danish full-scale WWTP.
